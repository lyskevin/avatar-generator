# Avatar Generator
A simple web server that generates random avatars (custom name and image). Built with NodeJS, Docker-Compose and Nginx.

## Instructions

1. Ensure that Docker and Docker-Compose are installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository. A folder called avatar-generator should appear.
3. Navigate into the avatar-generator folder from your terminal window.
4. Run the command `docker-compose up` from your terminal window.
5. Visit http://localhost on a web browser of your choice (I recommend Google Chrome) and have fun!
